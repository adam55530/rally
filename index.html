								<h3 color="FFFF99" class=headline> Acropolis around the corner </h3>
								<p> Next weekend will see the start of the 2002 Acropolis Rally,
									known as the toughest event at the season mid-point not
									only for it's blistering heat, but also the damage that is
									inflicted on the Ford Focus RS WRC cars by the rock strewn
									roads - this really is an extreme and challenging event.
									It is also one which has suited the Ford Rallye Sport team in
									the past showing the endurance and capabilities of the
									drivers and the reliability of the Ford Focus. With first
									place in 2000 and 2001 could it be a hat-trick win in
									2002? Keep logging on next week and we'll keep you up
									to date with all the news and results as they come in.</p>
