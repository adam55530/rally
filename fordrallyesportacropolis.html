										<p class="carspecbold" text-align="center">Location:Itea
											Date:14 - 16 June
											Weather: Hot and sunny, last year temperatures
											reached over 30 degrees

											Overview:</p><br/><br/><p
													text-align="center">The roughest rally in Europe - only the Safari
													can be described as tougher. One of the slowest events in the
													championship as rock strewn roads and strings of hairpins keep
													speeds down. Slow speeds and intense heat make engine cooling a
													problem and extreme cockpit temperatures ensure regular fluid
													intake is essential for crews. The rally now ignores the capital
													city of Athens and is based further north in the coastal town of
													Itea, just a few kilometres from the mountain town of Delphi
													according to the ancient Greeks, the true centre of the earth.

														</p>Ford and McRae took our third win of the year in Greece to put
														us in the lead of the Manufacturers' and Drivers' Championship.
														The rally was one of the toughest of the year with treacherous
														driving conditions and temperatures in the high 30s throughout.
														McRae's third consecutive victory was a rare feat. The last time
														the achievement was made was again by McRae back in 1995.<br/><br/>
																<p>Greece promised much for Carlos Sainz. Throughout the whole
																	rally Carlos and his co-driver Luis Moya had tracked McRae and
																	Grist. Going in to the final, long and demanding, stage of the
																	rally the Spanish pair were superbly positioned to take the
																	lead but cruel luck dropped them out of the rally when engine
																	failure forced their retirement.</p><br/><br/>

																			Delecour and Daniel Grataloup finished a magnificent fifth in
																			a rally where the drama took place before the start of the
																			first stage. While fitness training, Delecour fell from his
																			mountain bike and severely sprained his right wrist. He
																			persevered throughout the event (even putting up with power
																			steering failure) to gain two drivers' championship.</p>
